# Fit at Work

The topic of the miniHack was fitness. We knew that there already existed a lot of fitness sites suggesting the various 
exercises a person can do or various diets that a person can have but there is not a proper platform for people who spend a lot of 
time on-screen. </br>

Fitness is not just limited to exercising and eating well, it also means having a good posture, taking breaks from 
continuous stress. More often than not people who work are constantly stressed and this causes their productivity to decrease. 
The best solution to this, that is also backed by research is take breaks in the middle of working. This is what our web app does.  

## Features 

If the user is too engrossed in their work, We come in. We remind you to take a break, give your eyes the much needed rest.
It takes a note of the screen time of a user and sends them a message in time intervals to take a small break, relax their posture, 
stand up and walk, stretch, drink water etc. By giving a notification to the user on their desktop while they're working!
This leads to better concentration on their work with the added bonus of a little refreshment. 
The best thing about this app is that the user can set the time interval according to their preference.

The app was originally made to include ElectronJS to convert into a desktop app, so as to recieve pop up notifications as per scheduled.
